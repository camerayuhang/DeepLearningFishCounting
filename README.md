### Overview

Effective conservation actions require effective population monitoring. However, accurately counting animals in the wild to inform conservation decision-making is difficult. Monitoring populations through image sampling has made data collection cheaper, wide-reaching and less intrusive but created a need to process and analyse this data efficiently. Counting animals from such data is challenging, particularly when densely packed in noisy images. Attempting this manually is slow and expensive, while traditional computer vision methods are limited in their generalisability. Deep learning is the state-of-the-art method for many computer vision tasks, but it has yet to be properly explored to count animals. To this end, we employ deep learning, with a density-based regression approach, to count fish in low-resolution sonar images. We introduce a large dataset of sonar videos, deployed to record wild mullet schools <i>(Mugil liza)</i>, with a subset of 500 labelled images. We utilise abundant unlabelled data in a self-supervised task to improve the supervised counting task. For the first time in this context, by introducing uncertainty quantification, we improve model training and provide an accompanying measure of prediction uncertainty for more informed biological decision-making. Finally, we demonstrate the generalisability of our proposed counting framework through testing it on a recent benchmark dataset of high-resolution annotated underwater images from varying habitats (DeepFish). From experiments on both contrasting datasets, we demonstrate our network outperforms the few other deep learning models implemented for solving this task. By providing an open-source framework along with training data, our study puts forth an efficient deep learning template for crowd counting aquatic animals thereby contributing effective methods to assess natural populations from the ever-increasing visual data.

Figure 1: A multi-task deep convolutional network with aleatoric uncertainty regularization to count (dense schools of) fish in underwater images: one branch learns the supervised task of regressing an input image to an estimated fish count via a density mapping and simultaneously, parallel Siamese branches learn a self-supervised task of ranking pairs of images according to the number of fish - leveraging unlabelled data. (Inspired by an <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03095.pdf">algorithm</a> proved for counting people in crowds - these pairs have been generated by taking an original image P<sub>1</sub>, and comparing it to a cropped sample of this image P<sub>2</sub>. We added an additional layer to the output so our model learns to predict the noise variance within each labelled sample - producing a measure of "uncertainty" alongside each fish count estimate. The backbone of each branch is a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf">ResNet-50</a> followed by a 1x1 2D Convolutional layer. A non-learnable Global Average Pooling layer is added to each branch of the Siamese network so the resulting scaler count of image P<sub>1</sub> can be subtracted from image P<sub>2</sub>. The model is trained end-to-end and all parameters are shared (represented by the orange arrows) thus the self-supervised task can boost the performance of the core supervised task.

Figure 2: Novel dataset: 105 hours of sonar video footage were recorded at the estuarine canal in Laguna, southern Brazil. Here a rare cooporative foraging system has been established between wild dolphins and artisanal net-casting fishers to catch migrating mullet fish. A subset of this data has been labelled with the aim of training deep learning models to count the number of mullet fish in the captured footage. This subset contains 500 images with point annotations to mark the locations of mullet, bounding boxes to mark non-mullet noisy objects and an image bounding box to mark the geographical sample area.

(c) Manual annotation of individual mullets (point), dolphins - noise (bounding box) and geographical sample area (bounding box).
